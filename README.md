Academic Tree scraper
by Kevin J. O'Neill

This project consists of a python script which will scrape pages on academictree.org recursively to generate a hierarchical graph of all of someone's academic ancestors up to n generations back, as well as a display method using d3.js. 

To view further documentation and to see the visualization of my own family tree, please view the [github pages site](https://koneill1994.github.io/AcademicTreeVisualizer/index.html)
