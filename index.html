<h1>Academic Family Tree for Kevin O'Neill</h1>

<p>This project consists of a python script which will scrape pages on academictree.org recursively to generate a hierarchical graph of all of someone's academic ancestors up to n generations back, as well as a display method using d3.js.  </p>

<p>The original plan was to display the nodes in a hierarchical manner, but that proved difficult and time-consuming, so for the forseeable future they are in a confused jumble.  </p>

<p>You can drag the view around, and zoom with the scroll wheel.  Click and drag on a node to move it around.  </p>
